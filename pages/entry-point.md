# Entry point

_July 20, 2017_

I'm Andrey Polischuk, a frontend engineer. This site is my first try to write about tech things.

Finally I desided to create this site by reading the idea:

> You should have ability to write it, readers — to read it. Content is a king.
>

and one more:

> Document everything. Your memory is not infallible; future you will thank you.
>
> Publish everything you do. No matter how small, send it out into the world.
>
> — [Yoshua Wuyts](https://medium.com/@yoshuawuyts/how-to-become-a-successful-developer-6058723583ef)

So I'll publish what I find useful. Maybe this will be interest others.

This site was created as simple as possible:

* Open sourced and hosted on GitHub
* Written in markdown
* Fully static
* With automatic deployment
