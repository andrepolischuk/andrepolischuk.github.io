      </header><p>Developers widely use <a href="https://prometheus.io">Prometheus</a> as a system for operational monitoring and alerting for their projects. Here is a list of tools for monitoring frontend services with Prometheus.</p>
<p>Prometheus uses a pull model, meaning it periodically pulls metrics from the service endpoint via HTTP. For monitoring, a service should provide the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collect metrics</li>
<li>Accumulate metrics</li>
<li>Export metrics for delivery from an endpoint to Prometheus.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these purposes, you can use one of the open-source clients:</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/siimon/prom-client">prom-client</a> <a href="#a-href-https-github-com-siimon-prom-client-prom-client-a" data-anchor>#</a></h2><p>Prometheus client for Node.js, which covers all three above-mentioned conditions and supports histograms, summaries, gauges, and counters. It is used in Node.js APIs and also in applications with server-side rendering.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/ruanyl/prometheus-browser">prometheus-browser</a> <a href="#a-href-https-github-com-ruanyl-prometheus-browser-prometheus-browser-a" data-anchor>#</a></h2><p>Prometheus client for browsers, supporting the collection of metrics in browser services, for example, SPAs. It supports most metrics: histograms, gauges, and counters.</p>
<p>You need to store metrics from browsers somewhere, as Prometheus cannot pull metrics from there. For this, you can use one of the intermediate gateways that support the push model.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway">Pushgateway</a> <a href="#a-href-https-github-com-prometheus-pushgateway-pushgateway-a" data-anchor>#</a></h2><p>Intermediate gateway to push metrics from services where, for some reason, is not possible to support the pull model.</p>
<p>Pushgateway has a <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/">limited area</a> of application. It does not support aggregation and can mainly be used as a cache of metrics. Metrics in it will be stored in the same way as they were in the service from which the metrics were collected.</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/zapier/prom-aggregation-gateway">Aggregation Gateway</a> <a href="#a-href-https-github-com-zapier-prom-aggregation-gateway-aggregation-gateway-a" data-anchor>#</a></h2><p>Another intermediate gateway for Prometheus, but unlike the previous one with built-in aggregation of metrics. It can be used for monitoring a large number of distributed metrics.</p>
<p>It solves the problem of collecting metrics in the browser. A browser application can accumulate metrics within the scope of a single user session, which is X times greater than the instances of Node.js applications. The aggregating gateway sums up these individual short-lived metrics so that Prometheus can calculate changes in metrics over time.</p>
<h2>Conclusion <a href="#conclusion" data-anchor>#</a></h2><p>These tools fully cover the collection of metrics to Prometheus for operational monitoring of frontend services. For further reading, I recommend also checking out:</p>
