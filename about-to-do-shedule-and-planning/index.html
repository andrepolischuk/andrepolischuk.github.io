        <h1>About to-do, schedule and planning</h1>
      </header><em>
        <time>September 14, 2017</time></em><p>I don’t like a rigid planning.
Caledars, reminders, scheduled events are not for me.
But at the same time I want barely control things I want to do.</p>
<p>I don’t realy like set exact dates and times to do something.
I get up everyday at different times.
I come to work at one time, next day another.
I have two little children bringing a little bit of chaos into my life.</p>
<p>So I try to avoid schedules and complex planning for decades ahaid.
Treelike tremendous to-do lists with multy-level branching are too much for me.</p>
<p>For my life I have used a large number of planning methods and types, schedule,
<a href="http://bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a>,
notes with to-do lists, emails as a to-do list, many different task management apps,

And many others techniques whose names I have forgotten.</p>
<p>They all don’t work in full for me.
Generally I spent more time for processing than making things.</p>
<p>After a lot of unsuccessful attempts I had such requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things I have to do should be important and significant</li>
<li>All of them must be saved</li>
<li>It should be a simple</li>
<li>I don’t need to spend much time</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same moment I read article
&quot;<a href="https://medium.com/desk-of-van-schneider/the-big-list-59479fc0cbcd">The Big List</a>&quot;
by <a href="https://twitter.com/vanschneider">Tobias van Schneider</a>.
I tried to use it for a week, and it was magnificently.
I combined this idea with yet some rules and got working approach that didn’t force me spent a lot of resources.</p>
<h2>Main rules</h2>
<p>It’s very simple and contains only three points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use one list to write down all things you want to do</li>
<li>Avoid distractions and just keep doing</li>
<li>Do something by intervals to focus on task you do for a time</li>
</ul>
<p>I avoid using any reminders or scheduled events.
I don’t separate personal, work and other tasks and goals in the list.
There are some examples:</p>
<pre><code>task about clickjacking +
finalise to-do, schedule and planning
fix replace \n with space
code spliting and http/2
kernel mode vs. user mode
read latta
templates for vim
small car trip
write about automation: scripts, aliases
...
</code></pre>
<p>I add ideas to the list.
I add to the list what I want to do.
I add things that I want to learn.</p>
<p>Now, at the moment I going to do, I open the list, choose task and do it.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This simple system solves my problem of task management.
All saved.
I don’t lose or forget anything.
At any time I do what I want.
And I don’t spend a lot of time for organizing.</p>
<p>I don’t claim that it will be perfect for you as well as for me.
But you can steal some its parts that you will find useful.</p>
