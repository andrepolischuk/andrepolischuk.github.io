# Latest tools

_August 8, 2017_

Useful apps and tools that I found recently. JavaScript Standard Style, Firefox Focus, and some other.

Sometimes I try to use new tools for experiment. And new are often better for me than old ones. Early I wrote about I started use Vim and still use it.

For the last six months I replaced some my tools with new ones:

1. [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/standard/standard) — code linter and fixer using `eslint` under the hood. It's easy way to ensure beauty and consistent code style for your projects. Just install and you can use it. No configs, simple rules, no semicolons. Writing a code without semicolons is a great. Now I often forget append its when edit an old project. I used `eslint` with `airbnb` style before, but they are excessively complicated than Standard.

1. [UpnpServer](https://github.com/oeuillot/upnpserver-cli) — minimal UPnP server. It's open sourced. It has command-line interface and can share content to a lot of targets.

1. [Translate Shell](https://github.com/soimort/translate-shell) — easy access to Google Translate, Yandex.Translate and Bing Translator from command-line.

1. [Master Password](http://masterpasswordapp.com) — unique password generator. Passwords are created by reproducible algorithm and not stored to cloud or file system. It's open sourced and targets almost all platforms. I use Google Passwords and iCloud Keychain before, but they are not enough securely.

1. [Firefox Focus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-the-privacy-browser/id1055677337) — privacy-focused mobile browser from Mozilla. It blocks ads, analytics and social trackers. And works some faster than other mobile browsers. I recently use it as default mobile browser.
