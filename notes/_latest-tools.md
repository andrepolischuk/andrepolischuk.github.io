# Latest tools

_August 7, 2017_

Sometimes I try to use new tools for experiment. And new are often better and
simpler for me than old ones. Early I wrote about I started use Vim for
experiment and still use it.

I replaced some my tools with new for the last six months:

1. [JavaScript Standard Style](https://github.com/standard/standard) — code
  linter and fixer using `eslint` under the hood. It ensures beauty and simple
  code style for your projects. Just install and you can use it. No configs,
  simple rules, no semicolons. I used `eslint` with `airbnb` style before, but
  its are excessively complicated than Standard.

2. [UpnpServer](https://github.com/oeuillot/upnpserver-cli) — simple UPnP
  server. It's open sourced. It has command line interface and can share
  content to a lot of targets.

3. [OpenConnect](http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/) — simple command line
  VPN client supports Cisco SSL VPN.

4. [Master Password](http://masterpasswordapp.com) — unique password generator.
  Passwords are created by reproducible algorythm and not stored to cloud or
  file system. It's open sourced and targets almost all platforms. I use google
  passwords and iCloud keychain before, but its are not securely enough.

5. [Firefox Focus](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/firefox-focus-the-privacy-browser/id1055677337) — privacy-focused
  mobile browser from Mozilla. It blocks ads, analytics and social trackers.
  And works some faster than other browsers. I use it as default mobile browser recently.
