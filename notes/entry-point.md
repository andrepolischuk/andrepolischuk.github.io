# Entry point

_July 20, 2017_

I'm Andrey Polischuk, frontend engineer and open-source fan. This site is my
first try to write about tech things.

Finally I desided to create this site by reading some ideas:

> You should have ability to write it, readers — to read it. Content is a king.

> Document everything. Your memory is not infallible; future you will thank you.
>
> Publish everything you do. No matter how small, send it out into the world.
>

So I will publish what I found useful. Maybe this will iteresting for others.
I hope I will write regularly.

This site was created as simple as possible:

* Open sourced and hosted on GitHub
* Written in markdown
* Fully static
* With automatic deployment
