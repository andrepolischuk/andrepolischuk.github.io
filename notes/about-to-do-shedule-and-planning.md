# About to-do, schedule and planning

_September 14, 2017_

I don't like a rigid planning.
Caledars, reminders, scheduled events are not for me.
But at the same time I want barely control things I want to do.

I don't realy like set exact dates and times to do something.
I get up everyday at different times.
I come to work at one time, next day another.
I have two little children bringing a little bit of chaos into my life.

So I try to avoid schedules and complex planning for decades ahaid.
Treelike tremendous to-do lists with multy-level branching are too much for me.

For my life I have used a large number of planning methods and types, schedule,
[Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com),
notes with to-do lists, emails as a to-do list, many different task management apps,
[Not-To-Do List](https://tim.blog/2007/08/16/the-not-to-do-list-9-habits-to-stop-now/),
month goals,
[no goals](http://www.theminimalists.com/no-goals/),
[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done),
[Zen to Done](https://zenhabits.net/zen-to-done-ztd-the-ultimate-simple-productivity-system/),
[Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique),
[3 daily tasks](https://soverve.com/how-choosing-three-daily-tasks-can-increase-productivity/),
[1-3-5 Rule](https://www.fastcompany.com/3007885/1-3-5-rule-more-doable-do-lists),
[Eisenhower Matrix](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/23/eisenhower-decision-matrix/),
[Ivy Lee Method](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/james-clear/the-ivy-lee-method-the-da_b_10257938.html).
And many others techniques whose names I have forgotten.

They all don't work in full for me.
Generally I spent more time for processing than making things.

After a lot of unsuccessful attempts I was had such requirements:

* Things I have to do should be important and significant
* All of them must be saved
* It should be a simple
* I don't need to spend much time

At the same moment I read article
"[The Big List](https://medium.com/desk-of-van-schneider/the-big-list-59479fc0cbcd)"
by [Tobias van Schneider](https://twitter.com/vanschneider).
I tried to use it for a week, and it was magnificently.
I combined this idea with yet some rules and got working approach that didn't force me spent a lot of resources.

## Main rules

It's very simple and contains only three points:

* Use one list to write down all things you want to do
* Avoid distractions and just keep doing
* Do something by intervals to focus on task you do for a time

I don't separate personal, work and other tasks and goals in the list.
I avoid using any reminders or scheduled events.
Do I have some idea?
Do I want to do something?
Do I understand that I don't know anything?
I will add it to the list.
At the moment I going to do, I open the list, choose task and do it.

## Summary

This simple system solves my problem of task management.
All saved.
I don't lose or forget anything.
At any time I do what I want.
And I don't spend a lot of time for organizing.

I don't claim that it will be perfect for you as well as for me.
But you can steal some its parts that you will find useful.
